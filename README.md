# REACT Counter Project

## What is this project about?

This React Counter project offers users the opportunity to count with a little twist on the "Add value" button.
This project is built with [React](https://react.dev) JS library and CSS, using the [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) tool

# Getting Started

#### Installing Dependencies

1.  **Installing Node and NPM**
    This project builds on top of Nodejs and Node Package Manager (NPM). Before continuing, you must download and install Node (the download includes NPM) from [https://nodejs.com/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

2.  **Installing project dependencies**
    To create a project called React-counter, run this command:

    ```bash
    npx create-react-app React-counter
    ```

    Alternatively, you can use the command:

    ```bash
    npm create-react-app React-counter
    ```

    To know the difference between "npx" and "npm", visit [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-are-the-differences-between-npm-and-npx/) for more.

    To install all dependencies or devDependencies from package.json file, run this command from terminal:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    > _tip_: `npm i` is shorthand for `npm install``

### Running Your Frontend in Dev Mode

The frontend app was built using the React Library with create-react-app (as the bundler). In order to run the app in development mode use `npm start`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.
